Try to follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html

/usr/local is a RW filesystem (maybe ram, maybe browser persistent)

/usr is a R only filesystem shared, coming from the web

Not sure if / should be a RW ramfs with lots of static fs children or a R only static filesystem.

Source code for binaries in /bin or /usr/bin or /sbin or /usr/sbin goes in /usr/src, probably as the output of git archive as .tar.gz.

Users can install in /usr/local or /opt.

/etc should be RW local filesystem, with defaults.
