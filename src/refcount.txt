Refcounted objects contain a count or collection of things referencing them,
when that count is decremented from 1 to 0, a dispose function is called.
The refcount starts at 0 at creation; this is a special state.
After creating a new refcounted object, users should ensure that the refcount is incremented
(by storing a reference in an appropriate loctaion and calling the appropriate incRefCount
method), or explicitly calling dispose.
