OSoap:
check file permissions
move pid_t to 64 bits - requires changes in osoap-libc, and porting syscalls taking or returning pids to new ones
refactor linux syscall boilerplate
convert to typescript
link mount file type
getrusage
getdents - handle mount points

osoap-libc:
src/time/timer_create.c uses setjmp/longjmp
src/signal - sigsetjmp and siglongjmp are broken
__unmapself is getting referenced from pthread_create, and we don't support threads yet

coreutils:
reenable HAVE_TIMER_SETTIME in timeout.c (implementation needs pthread operations)
reenable sort.c (needs pthread operations)
