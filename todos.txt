osoap-libc:
src/time/timer_create.c uses setjmp/longjmp
src/signal - sigsetjmp and siglongjmp are broken
__unmapself is getting referenced from pthread_create, and we don't support threads yet

coreutils:
reenable HAVE_TIMER_SETTIME in timeout.c (implementation needs pthread operations)
reenable sort.c (needs pthread operations)
