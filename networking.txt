Networking:

connections that stay within the virtual machine can be emulated with high fidelity.
This allows for example local dev servers binding to localhost, and web browsers connecting to them.

For connections that leave the virtual machine, including connections to the host loopback, we are heavily
constrained by the browser security model. This means pretty much only http requests, and CORS-headers need
to be set for services on a different origin from where the vm is hosted (this may include localhost,
if the vm is served remotely).

I am imagining a system where programs can open tcp/ip sockets, and as long as they write a valid HTTP
request to the socket, the operating system can buffer that request, promote it to an XMLHttpRequest, and
lower the response back to tcp/ip.

Many services can be accessed over http/https. This includes git, dns, npm, apt, pip.

use 10.0.2.2 to refer to host loopback/localhost, and
fdf1:bf31:12d6::/48, specifically fdf1:bf31:12d6::2 for ipv6
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4193

for internal localhost: 127.0.0.1 (really all of 127.0.0.0/8), and ::1 for ipv6
