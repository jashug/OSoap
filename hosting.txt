Azure Static Web Apps seems to have the functionality I am currently using.

Set globalHeaders to include
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

We can also set headers per-route, which gives lots of flexibility.

Allowing the client to request different mime-types for different files might require
keeping copies of all the filesystem data with different extensions.
Hopefully we can use symlinks or hardlinks to avoid duplicating the data.
Symlinks seem the most likely solution.

This might not turn out to be an issue at all;
maybe serving all data files as application/wasm will work,
or maybe we can have routes check a query parameter or something.
