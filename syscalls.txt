Syscalls will be implemented through a memory buffer, one atomic word to synchronize on,
which allows for blocking syscalls.

When using waitAsync on the kernel side, be careful not to create a reference cycle to memory
via the callback.

One syscall_buffer for each thread.

On the kernel side, use AbortControler and AbortSignal to cancel in the middle?
