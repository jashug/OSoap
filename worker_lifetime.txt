TODO: make pid's 64 bits long

When a worker is first created (with new Worker('src/worker.js', {type: 'module'})),
it is in the idle state.

On start message, worker transions from idle to busy-no-sysbuf state.

On error, a worker transitions from wherever to the idle state. If we have a sysbuf, drop it.

On message 'register_syscall_buffer', transition from busy-no-sysbuf state to busy state.

While in busy state, listen to the sysbuf, and service syscalls.

When in the busy state and recieve syscall 'detach' (work on the name, this may be combinable with
standard linux syscalls), delete the reference to the sysbuf.
This is not redundant, because it allows the kernel to avoid a trailing waitAsync from hanging around.

To exit, worker throws a OSoapExit exception with the exit code, which gets passed back to the kernel.
Should already have exit code from detach syscall, check that they match.
No, this can all be done with the detach syscall. (Should be immediately followed by throwing an exception
in order to exit the webassembly, without interposing the event queue.)

In worker, catch traps and try to call detach?
